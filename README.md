# Investigation on Electrical Resistance Measurement in Conductive Polymer Composite Under Dynamic Loading  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This repository documents the Final Year Project of **Muhammad Fathul Hadi Bin Mohd Nizam** at **Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM)**.  

The study investigates the **electrical resistance behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs)** printed on **Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)** when subjected to **dynamic loading conditions** such as:  
- **Cyclic torsional stress** (60Â°â€“180Â° twist)  
- **Creep deformation** (up to 20% elongation)  
- **Thermal variation** (25Â°C â€“ 45Â°C)  

The aim was to evaluate the **durability, stability, and sensing capability** of CPCs for applications in **flexible electronics, strain sensors, and wearable technology**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
The project set out to:  
1. Investigate **electrical resistance behavior** of CPCs under **cyclic torsional loading**.  
2. Examine the correlation between **creep deformation** and resistance variation.  
3. Evaluate the **impact of thermal expansion** on electrical performance.  
4. Analyze **surface changes** in CPCs using optical microscopy under torsional & creep loading.

## ðŸ“Œ Scope of Project  
- **Fabrication** of graphene-based conductive ink on TPU via **stencil printing**.  
- **Resistance testing** under torsional fatigue and creep conditions.  
- Correlation of **mechanical loading cycles** with resistance drift and failure thresholds.  
- **Microscopic analysis** to identify defects such as cracks, delamination, and roughness.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology  
- **Printing & Curing**: Graphene nanoplatelets ink on TPU substrate.  
- **Testing**:  
  - **Cyclic torsion** (60Â°â€“180Â°, up to 1000 cycles).  
  - **Creep test** (4%â€“20% elongation, up to 150 minutes).  
  - **Temperature variation** (25Â°C â€“ 45Â°C).  
- **Measurements**: Electrical resistance via **Four-point probe (Jandel RM3000)**.  
- **Morphology**: Surface observation using **Zeiss Axioplan 2 optical microscope**.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results  
- **Torsion Tests**:  
  - Resistance increased with **higher cycle counts** and **larger twist angles**.  
  - Example: At 180Â° torsion, resistance rose from **1.755 â„¦ (200 cycles)** to **3.052 â„¦ (1000 cycles)**.  

- **Creep Tests**:  
  - Resistance increased progressively with **longer durations** and **higher elongations**.  
  - At 20% elongation: resistance escalated from **4.512 â„¦ to 23.247 â„¦ in 150 minutes**, indicating **plastic deformation & failure**.  

- **Temperature Influence**:  
  - Higher temperatures amplified resistance increases due to **thermal expansion & filler misalignment**.  
  - Example: At 180Â° torsion, resistance rose from **1.810 â„¦ (25Â°C)** to **3.172 â„¦ (45Â°C)**.  

- **Surface Morphology**:  
  - Microscopy confirmed **microcracks, delamination, and roughness** on damaged samples, linking physical degradation with resistance instability.

## âœ… Conclusion  
- CPCs on TPU showed **sensitivity to torsion, creep, and thermal loading**, making them **promising low-cost strain sensors**.  
- However, **mechanical fatigue and temperature effects** significantly degraded resistance stability.  
- All research objectives were successfully achieved.

## ðŸš€ Recommendations for Future Work  
1. **Material & Filler Optimization**: Hybrid fillers (e.g., Graphene + CNTs), crosslinking agents for stability.  
2. **Advanced Testing**: Extended cyclic fatigue (>2000 cycles), multi-axial twist, and cyclic creep.  
3. **Wider Temperature Range**: Testing in sub-zero (0Â°C) and higher (up to 80Â°C).  
4. **Sensor Integration**: Embedding CPCs into IoT devices (Arduino/ESP32 with wireless monitoring).  
5. **High-Resolution Imaging**: SEM/3D profilometry for detailed crack mapping and predictive modeling.
