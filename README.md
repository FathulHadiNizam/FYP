# Investigation on Electrical Resistance Measurement in Conductive Polymer Composite Under Dynamic Loading  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This is the Final Year Project (FYP) of **Muhammad Fathul Hadi Bin Mohd Nizam** at **Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM)**.  

The research investigates the **electrical resistance behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs)** printed on **Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)** under **dynamic loading conditions**:  
- **Cyclic torsional stress** (60Â°â€“180Â° twist)  
- **Creep deformation** (up to 20% elongation)  
- **Thermal variation** (25Â°C â€“ 45Â°C)  

The goal is to evaluate **durability, stability, and sensing performance** of CPCs for **flexible electronics, strain sensors, and wearable devices**.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology  
- **Materials**: Graphene nanoplatelets, CNTs, PEDOT:PSS, TPU substrate.  
- **Printing & Curing**: Conductive ink stencil printed and thermally cured.  
- **Tests Conducted**:  
  - **Cyclic Torsion**: 60Â°â€“180Â°, up to 1000 cycles.  
  - **Creep Test**: 4%â€“20% elongation, up to 150 min.  
  - **Thermal Variation**: 25Â°Câ€“45Â°C.  
- **Measurements**: Four-point probe (Jandel RM3000).  
- **Microscopy**: Zeiss Axioplan 2 MAT for surface observation.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Findings  
- **Torsion Tests**  
  - Resistance rose with **higher twist angles & more cycles**.  
  - Example: 180Â° torsion â†’ **1.755 â„¦ (200 cycles)** â†’ **3.052 â„¦ (1000 cycles)**.  

- **Creep Tests**  
  - Resistance increased with **elongation % and duration**.  
  - Example: At 20% elongation â†’ **4.512 â„¦ â†’ 23.247 â„¦ (150 min)**.  

- **Temperature Influence**  
  - Higher temperatures **amplified resistance drift**.  
  - Example: 180Â° torsion â†’ **1.810 â„¦ (25Â°C)** â†’ **3.172 â„¦ (45Â°C)**.  

- **Surface Morphology**  
  - Microscopy showed **cracks, delamination, and roughness**, matching resistance instability.

## âœ… Conclusion  
- CPCs on TPU are **sensitive to torsion, creep, and heat**, making them promising for **strain sensing**.  
- However, **mechanical fatigue & thermal effects** reduce long-term stability.  
- All project objectives were successfully achieved.

## ðŸš€ Recommendations  
1. Use **hybrid fillers** (Graphene + CNTs) or crosslinking agents.  
2. Test extended cycles (>2000) & multi-axial loading.  
3. Evaluate wider **temperature ranges (0Â°C â€“ 80Â°C)**.  
4. Integrate CPCs into **IoT devices** (Arduino/ESP32 for wireless sensing).  
5. Employ **SEM/3D profilometry** for detailed defect analysis.
